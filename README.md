# Rainy Road App

### An app to be ready for you trips


When i travel by motocycle in winter, it is common to not being raining where i started the trip, but raining on the city i was going to go or somewhere in the road.
So, i wouldn't be prepared for the rain waiting for me somewhere along my path.

I build this app for this, it will show if its raining on the road to your destination.

It is pre-set with my hosted server with limited processing and ram, so longer routes cannot be processed. I recomend hosting your own server. You can get the server side script [here](https://github.com/rtalis/rainy_road).

## Getting Started

Get the latest stable version from releases or you can compile your own apk with:

`flutter build apk --release`

It uses flutter on the app and the map is generated on a server that you can set as well.
